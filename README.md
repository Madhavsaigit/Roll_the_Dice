# Roll_the_Dice
This game consists of two players , Player1 and Player 2
The first chance of rolling the dice will be to the Player1
Each Player would be having their Global scores on top & Each player would be having a current score which will be storing their current score for every instance they roll the dice
The one that reaches a Global score of 100 will be the winner 
So here we have some pre-defined rules:

A Player can roll the dice any number of times until he rolls '1' on the dice, or he can roll the dice and press the 'Hold' button which transfers the control to the another Player
So if any Player rolls '1' their respective current score for the instance will become '0' and the dice will be transferred to another Player
So a Player can add up their current scores and pressing the Hold button 
So any Player needs to add up their current scores without rolling '1' on the dice, and press the Hold button to add their current score to the Global Score
